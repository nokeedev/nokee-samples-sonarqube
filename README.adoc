= Sonarqube Demonstration for Gradle Native

The implementation support every native implementation, e.g. Nokee and Gradle core native (current/software model).
It relies the `AbstractNativeCompileTask` task which is shared between all implementations.

== How to use?

Execute your build normally with the `sonarqube` task: `./gradlew build sonarqube`

== How it works?

The plugin extract the information from the compile tasks present in the task graph and create a `build-wrapper-dump.json` per project.
The root project merge all `build-wrapper-dump.json` files which is then passed to the `SonarQubeTask`.
The task comes from the `org.sonarqube` plugin directly.
